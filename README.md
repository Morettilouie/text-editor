# text-editor

run an app for text editing in the browser

when the user has poor or no connection the app has stored servic workers that will keep the app running

the information needed for the user is stored in the indexedDB so they have the data they need to keep the app running

the webpack configuration pulled everything needed to run the app from the index.js and stores it in cache storage
